This is my current Diptrace Custom Components & Patterns. I don't in
anyway claim that all of these Components or patterns are mine, some in
particular the Analog devices or Neutrik XLR connectors i have derived
from other tools or websites to use in diptrace. As i make more
componets or improve my current ones i will push updates on a regular
base.Yes i know there are duplicates here compared to the built in libaries but i often made changes/improvments to these. Please feel free to make your own custom libaries avalible here too.
